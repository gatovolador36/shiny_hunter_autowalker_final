note: will need to download sprites for this to work, and save it as a folder named shiny_sprites
here is the link to the sprites: https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/gen5ani-shiny/
This only works for pokemon bw/bw2. I can see about implementing a shiny hunter for other gens but as of 2/19/2025 this is all I've been able to get to work
Thank you guys for your support!
